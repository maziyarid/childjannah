SEO and Technical Recovery Checklist

Spam URL Cleanup: The critical priority is to remove spam URLs. Block these URLs and delete any spam files from your hosting environment.

Robots.txt and .htaccess Updates: Use the changes in .htaccess to block spam patterns and implement 410 Gone responses. Ensure your robots.txt is correctly configured to allow essential resources and block unnecessary ones.

Technical SEO Fixes:

Redirect Chains: Fix 301 redirects that are causing slowdowns or improper routing.

Indexing Issues: Remove noindex tags from pages that should be indexed.

Canonical Tags: Ensure that correct canonical tags are implemented to prevent duplicate content.

Content Fixes:

Add Featured Images: Several posts and pages need to have featured images added. This is an essential SEO element.

Optimize Meta Descriptions: Many pages are missing meta descriptions, which should be added for better SEO performance.

Image Alt Text: Ensure all images have relevant alt text for SEO purposes.

SEO Score: Aim to improve the SEO scores for pages using Yoast or RankMath.

Backlink Cleanup:

Disavow spammy backlinks, particularly from domains with high spam scores.

GSC Monitoring: Keep track of your Google Search Console for crawl errors, indexing statuses, and manual penalties.

Security Measures: Ensure your .htaccess is configured correctly to block malicious bots and prevent potential security threats.

New Tasks Discovered

From analyzing the WordPress export and the current issues with your site, I suggest you begin by addressing the following, specifically related to content and images:

Add Featured Images: 53 posts and pages are missing featured images.

SEO Score Improvements: 110 posts have SEO scores below the optimal range; consider enhancing those with better titles, descriptions, and content length.
