Hi. I want you to analyse all these files I have provided; as you can see, there are many errors. My theme is Jannah news, but I have added all the attached files as code snippets in WP Code. There are both UI/UX issues and technical errors, so my SEO has dropped significantly. I want you to find all the problems, one by one, and provide instructions on how to fix all of them, so whilst my score in page speed will be 100%, my core web vitals be validated, no console errors and also no technical issues or UI/UX problems in the current version. I am considering applying the changes to the same Jannah news, but in the child theme version instead of the WP Code. I want to make it ultra-lightweight and fix all issues with the pages. There are many unwanted fields and options there. I'd rather use the built-in Jannah news shortcodes and documentation rather than add my own. Considering all these, diagnose and provide me with an instruction for Claude Sonnet 4.6 that provides the codes one by one, explains the whole problem, and doesn't miss anything. also let me know if you can help me directly so we can fix it step by step.
